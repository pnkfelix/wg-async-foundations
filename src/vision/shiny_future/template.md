# âœ¨ Shiny future stories: template

*This is a template for adding new "shiny future" stories. To propose a new shiny future PR, do the following:*

* *Create a new file in the [`shiny_future`] directory named something like `Alan_loves_foo.md` or `Grace_does_bar_and_its_great.md`, and start from [the raw source from this template]. You can replace all the italicized stuff. :)*
* *Do not add a link to your story to the [`SUMMARY.md`] file; we'll do it after merging, otherwise there will be too many conflicts.*

*For more detailed instructions, see the [How To Vision: Shiny Future] page!*

### ðŸ›‘ Not time for this yet ðŸ›‘

We are not yet accepting shiny future story ideas!

## ðŸš§ Warning: Draft status ðŸš§

This is a draft "shiny future" story submitted as part of the brainstorming period. It is a speculative sketch of what life might be like in 2 to 3 years, if things go well.

If you would like to expand on this story, or adjust the answers to the FAQ, feel free to open a PR making edits (but keep in mind that, as they reflect peoples' dreams, shiny future stories [cannot be wrong], only unclear or over-ambitious). Alternatively, you may wish to [add your own shiny future story][htvsf]!
